Nadir - Image Processing and MCU:
-Ordered new camera that did not work. Cable was wrong size.
-Trying to rebuild OpenCV from source one more time with the latest
 version and with ffmpeg & Gstreamer support.
-spoke briefly with toradex support to get an issue started and to get some
 help with the camera integration. Not helpful

Jacob - Hardware & Motor Control:
Stepper motors and extension cables have been purchased(9/10) and received (9/12)
Stepper control boxes will be ordered pending Vijay's approval. These are sold on Amazon so they should be delivered by Monday.
PCB is in-progress but I need to find a way to reduce to 1oz copper from 3oz. This is on the back-burner because I'm focusing on integration
